# VelociLogic Platform

VelociLogic is an end-to-end platform designed to streamline organizational process management through powerful automation tools, extensible web interfaces, and a developer-centric command-line interface (CLI). It blends the power of low-code/no-code workflow creation, DevOps-friendly orchestration, and comprehensive observability to enable enterprise-scale automation.

Designed with security and compliance in mind, VelociLogic provides **fine-grained Access Control Lists (ACLs)** and **policy-based security enforcement** to ensure strict authorization of both data and configuration access. Whether it’s securing environment-level secrets, restricting access to workflow components, or managing tenant-level data policies, VelociLogic empowers administrators to define controls down to the minutest detail—ensuring enterprise-grade isolation, auditability, and compliance readiness.

## 🚀 Key Components

### 🔹 VelociLogic-CLI

A powerful command-line interface tailored for developers and DevOps engineers. It provides secure, programmatic access to platform capabilities—ideal for automation, CI/CD pipelines, and integration scenarios.

- OAuth2 and API-key-based authentication
- Secure secret management
- Workflow deployment and execution
- Component provisioning
- Detailed execution logs
- Built-in help and autocomplete support

Example:

```bash
velocilogic auth login --api-key YOUR_KEY
velocilogic deploy workflow ./myworkflow.yaml
velocilogic run task --id 1234 --verbose
velocilogic secret add db-password --value="supersecret"
```

### 🔹 VelociLogic Web Platform
The central web application interface of VelociLogic will initially follow a monolithic architecture and offer core capabilities such as:

- Workflow builder (drag-and-drop logic canvas)
- SLA-driven task management and monitoring
- Reusable widget-based UI rendering
- Process configuration via GUI and JSON
- Role-based access and component-level ACL enforcement
- Real-time logging and analytics dashboards

- Future capabilities will include:
    - Studio-like Workflow Designer (next-gen Flow Designer)
    - Component-based UI Studio with reusable modules
    - Tenant and instance manager for multi-organization support
    - AI-driven process suggestions

### 🧱 Initial Architecture
Phase 1: Monolithic Containerized Application

+-------------------------------------------------+
|                VelociLogic Platform             |
|-------------------------------------------------|
| Web App (Next.js / Nuxt / Svelte)               |
|  ├─ Workflow Builder (Canvas, Logic DSL)        |
|  ├─ SLA Manager                                 |
|  ├─ Widget Renderer (UI Components)             |
|  ├─ Role/ACL Config Manager                     |
|                                                 |
| Backend (Go / Node.js / Python)                 |
|  ├─ API Gateway                                 |
|  ├─ Workflow Engine                             |
|  ├─ AuthZ / AuthN (OAuth2 / JWT / ACLs)         |
|  ├─ CLI Dispatcher                              |
|  ├─ Secrets Manager                             |
|  └─ Event Bus (Redis / NATS)                    |
|                                                 |
| Observability Layer                             |
|  ├─ Prometheus (Metrics)                        |
|  ├─ Grafana (Dashboards)                        |
|  └─ Loki / Fluent Bit (Logs)                    |
+-------------------------------------------------+

The monolith is fully containerized and orchestrated via Kubernetes, laying the groundwork for future microservice decomposition.

### 🔐 Security & Access Control
VelociLogic is built with security as a first-class citizen. The platform supports:

- OAuth2.0 / JWT Authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Object-level Access Control Lists (ACLs) for data, workflows, secrets, and widgets
- Secrets encryption at rest and in transit
- Audit logging of all user actions and system events
- Tenant isolation for multi-org deployments
- API Rate Limiting & Throttling


#### Example Access Control Matrix:

| Role       | Scope            | Actions Allowed                |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Admin      | Global           | Full access to all resources   |
| Developer  | Project-specific | Create/edit workflows, secrets |
| Viewer     | Instance-level   | Read-only access to dashboards |
| Integrator | API Endpoints    | Limited access via API tokens  |

### 📦 Deployment

#### Requirements

- Docker + Kubernetes
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB (modular DB layer)
- Redis (for caching/event bus)
- Prometheus + Grafana + Loki (Observability stack)
- Helm (for future Helm chart-based deployments)

### Quick start (Deployment)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/velocilogic.git
cd velocilogic

# Start the platform
docker-compose up --build
```
Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts will be provided in upcoming releases for scalable and production-ready deployment.

### 📈 Observability Stack
